# Home-Automation-using-blynk
During my IoT internship, I worked on a "Home Automation using Blynk" project. I created a smart system using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and Blynk app to remotely control home appliances. This improved energy efficiency and taught me IoT hardware, wireless communication, and app integration.
